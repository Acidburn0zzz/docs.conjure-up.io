# VMware vSphere

**conjure-up** is able to talk to vSphere's API endpoint and obtain necessary
information to provide the user with more control over which datacenter to use,
what networks for primary/external networks, and preferred datastore.

![vSphere Credentials][vspherecreds]

Once the **endpoint**, **username**, and **password** have been entered, you
will be prompted to select a region.

![vSphere Region][chooseregion]

Finally, **conjure-up** will present you with the additional networks and
datastores you can select from to further customize the deployment.

![vSphere Setup][vspheresetup]
