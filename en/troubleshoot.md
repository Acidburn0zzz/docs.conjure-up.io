# Troubleshooting

## Logging

Logs are written to `journald` by default. Logs may be viewed with the command:

```bash
journalctl |grep conjure-up
```

!!! Note:
    There is also a log file that is written to
    `$HOME/.cache/conjure-up/conjure-up.log`

## Unicode

If the system running `conjure-up` does not have its locale defined to
`UTF-8` a failure will occur similar to:

```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2201:
ordinal not in range(128)
```

To fix you will need to set your locale accordingly. Run the following command
to view current settings:

```bash
locale
```

The output from the above command will appear similar to the following:

```ini
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

## Common Problems

### Applications in Error state

One of the biggest reasons why applications will error out during deployment is
due to not having enough disk space available. Please make sure you meet the
[Hardware Requirements][hardware] prior to deploying spells.

### LXD

#### Failed deployments if IPv6 is enabled

Currently **conjure-up** does not support the use of IPv6. If you are running
LXD and have a bridge that has IPv6 enabled **conjure-up** will fail. The
output will include an explanation why and information for disabling IPv6.

#### Disable IPv6 on LXD versions 2.2 and below

LXD version 2.0 is the default version on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04. To disable IPv6
youâ€™ll need to edit `/etc/default/lxd-bridge` and make sure the following
values are reflected below:

```ini
# IPv6 address (e.g. 2001:470:b368:4242::1)
LXD_IPV6_ADDR=""

# IPv6 CIDR mask (e.g. 64)
LXD_IPV6_MASK=""

# IPv6 network (e.g. 2001:470:b368:4242::/64)
LXD_IPV6_NETWORK=""

# NAT IPv6 traffic
LXD_IPV6_NAT="false"
```

#### Disable IPv6 on LXD versions 2.4 and above

To disable IPv6 on your LXD bridge (`lxdbr0` by default) run the following:

```no-highlight
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.nat false
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.address none
```
